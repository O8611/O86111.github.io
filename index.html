    <p>In my spare time at Waldâ€™s Parts junk shop I               designed and built a Class III open
        cockpit Podracer capable of 588 mph top speed. Went         on to win the Boonta Eve
        Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a human.         Generated documented company
        revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the course of my           enslavement.

    <p>During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet                Commander I was in charge of large
       capital construction projects for the Deep Space            Fleet. Performed acceptance
       testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by                    annihilating Alderaan - a terrestrial
       class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully        tripled the deep space fire
       power of the imperial fleet in accordance with the          Tarkin Doctrine before losing
       both projects to run-away photon torpedoes.
